The collected data is then analyzed and visualized to provide insights into the most sought-after programming languages in the job market for the given criteria.

You can modify the job title and location variables in the notebook to analyze different roles and regions. 

You can add more programming languages or skills to the `skills.csv` file to expand the analysis further.
